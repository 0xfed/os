# Wolfi

This is the main package repository for the Wolfi project.

Named after the [smallest octopus][wiki-ow], Wolfi is a lightweight GNU
software distribution which is designed around minimalism, making it
well-suited for containerized environments built with [apko][apko].

It is built using [melange][melange], and is sponsored by [Chainguard][cg],
which uses it to provide [lightweight GNU/Linux runtime images][cgi].
